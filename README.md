# Springboard - Introduction to Data science course

This comprehensive course covered data science techniques like data wrangling, visualization, statistical analysis and machine learning 
algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Clustering, Regression Trees, using R. Successful completion of the course required 
several hours of coursework, assignments and capstone project. In addition, I also had an opportunity to have weekly interaction with a 
mentor, a data science expert from industry.
